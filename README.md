#Solar.js

Model of the solar system in HTML5 canvas.

## Goals
I want to eventually get as many planets, moons, asteroids, etc, represented in this tiny app, with accurate orbits and real-time planet positions on a 2D plane, with the ability to zoom and scroll around the solar system and get info about each planet/moon, etc.

## Why?
I wanted to get to know HTML5 canvas a bit more, and I'm fascinated with celestial bodies. Space is crazy town banana pants!

## How do I use it?
Download the [zip file](https://github.com/cfurrow/solar.js/zipball/master)

Or, clone the repo:
    
    git clone https://cfurrow@github.com/cfurrow/solar.js.git
   
Once you've got the files, just open index.html in any browser to see it.
