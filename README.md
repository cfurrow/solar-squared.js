#solar-squared.js

Not-to-scale solar system model where everything is square and nothing makes sense.


## Why?
I wanted to get to know HTML5 canvas a bit more, and I'm fascinated with celestial bodies. Space is crazy town banana pants!

Clone the repo, open up index.html in your browser. You can be amazed if you want, but it's not a requirement or an expectation.
